## How to Run Locally

Since this is a static website (HTML/CSS/JS), you can easily run it locally using `npx` to serve the files.

### Option 1: Using `serve` (Recommended)

Run the following command in this directory:

```bash
npx serve .
```

### Option 2: Using `http-server`

Alternatively:

```bash
npx http-server .
```

Once the server starts, open the URL displayed in your terminal (typically `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:8080`) in your browser to view the site.
